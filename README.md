# Multiclipboard

This is a simple helper to save text from the clipboard to different keywords
to recall it later on.
The script is basically a recreation of the multiclip program illustrated
inside "Automate the boring stuff" by Al Sweigart, which I did just for fun.
Instead of using ```sys.argv``` I opted for the ```argparse``` module, though.
